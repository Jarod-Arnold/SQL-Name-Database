# SQL Names Database

This was a college python project in my early years. This project introduced us to SQL, databases, and creating GUI with pygubudesigner. This project asks you to enter a name, select Male or Female, and it will return the years with the most 
that were named that from 1915-2014.

# How to Use (With an IDE)
- Run the 'NamesDatabaseApp.py' file in your IDE
- Press F5 (or the start script button in your IDE) to run the program
- Type in a name of your choosing
- Select the Male or Female radio button depending on the chosen name

# Technology Used
- Python
- Pygubudesigner & Tkinter: For GUI
- Pymssql: For SQL
